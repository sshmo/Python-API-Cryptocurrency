# Python-API-Cryptocurrency

(*This project is an updated version of: ['Python-And-Cryptocurrencies-2018](https://github.com/phennaux/Python-and-cryptocurrencies)' created by Philippe Hennaux that was entirely made thanks to an Udemy course created by Ian Annase ['Python & Cryptocurrency: Build 5 Real World Applications-2018](https://www.udemy.com/coinmarketcap/)' The Public API that was used in ['Python & Cryptocurrency: Build 5 Real World Applications](https://www.udemy.com/coinmarketcap/)' was changed to ['Professional API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)' in 2018. Since then a lot of changes has occured.*)


In this project we use the __*sandbox version*__ with the corresponding sandbox API key to retrieve data from ['coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com)'.
