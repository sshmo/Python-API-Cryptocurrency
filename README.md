# Python-API-Cryptocurrency

(*This project is an updated version of: ['Python-And-Cryptocurrencies-2018](https://github.com/phennaux/Python-and-cryptocurrencies)' created by Philippe Hennaux that was entirely made thanks to an Udemy course created by Ian Annase ['Python & Cryptocurrency: Build 5 Real World Applications-2018](https://www.udemy.com/coinmarketcap/)'*)


The Public API that was used in ['Python & Cryptocurrency: Build 5 Real World Applications](https://www.udemy.com/coinmarketcap/)' was migrated to ['Professional API in 2018.](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)' since then a lot of changes has occured in the last two years.

Since v1.0.2 on Aug 17, 2018, A new sandbox.coinmarketcap.com was dedicated for testing environment. In this project we use the sandbox version with the corresponding sandbox API key to retrieve data from ['coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com)'. The data from the sandbox is not up-to-date and you need a costume user account for up-to-date results.
